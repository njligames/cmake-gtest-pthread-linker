Diagnose and fix linker failures in a CMake-based C++ project using GoogleTest and pthreads, manifesting as undefined references to gtest_main and pthread symbols. Update CMakeLists.txt to properly find and link GTest::GTest, GTest::Main, and Threads::Threads, enable POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE, then verify that tests compile, link, and run successfully.
